#### This is the custom LuminOS and SDK extensions
okay, here the things become interessing, look,  
first, Linux kernel read the actual file type by the file header, NOT by the extension, so, every app extension is as application that can run in any linux distro  
custom extensions is made to organize the files.

.sdkx : official system LuminSDK executable<br>
.runx : applications made using LuminSDK or for LuminOS<br>
.photon : applications made with C++ and phantom lib<br>
.sln : this is just... Visual Studio project, thats almost useless, but it will be used in some builds =3

these app extensions will appear on LuminOS CodeName "Eclipse" build 2097
