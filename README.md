# LuminOS 
an operating system based on Linux, optimized for C# and focused on privacy and design.  
LuminOS is still in early development, so expect bugs and missing features.

## Details

- Based on Ubuntu/Debian Linux
- Uses C# as main programming language, and Avalonia for the UI
- Focus on privacy and design.

## LuminSDK
that's the main part of LuminOS, thats written in C# to integrate C# programs with the OS.
LuminOS itself isn't written entirely in C#, as that would be unfeasible, due to the lack of programs made for it.  
#### If you want to try LuminSDK in early versions, here's a tutorial FOR WINDOWS (Linux will be added soon):
- Clone this repo  
Enter this folder:
```
<cloned_repo>/LuminSDK/bin/Debug/net8.0/
```
- Open a terminal on that folder and run:
```
Overlay
```
This will start LuminSDK, on a terminal emulator.<br>
### Also
LuminSDK is made for SYSTEM APPS, any third party apps should use DotNet 8.0LTS (latest LTS version) for linux  
and you can use LuminSDK Community, that's just a .cs file you can integrate on your project<br>
LuminSDK Community is not avaible yet, cause it's based on LuminSDK, that's in early development, and is completely unstable.
